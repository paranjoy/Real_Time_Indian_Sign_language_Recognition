# REAL TIME INDIAN SIGN LANGUAGE RECOGNITION
> This project aims to develop a software to recognize the various Indian Sign Language hand-gestures.
> Many people in India are speech and/or hearing impaired, and they thus use hand gestures to communicate with other people. However apart from a handful number of people, not everyone is aware of this sign language and they may require an interpreter which can be inconvenient and expensive. This project aims to narrow this communication gap by developing software which can predict the ISL alphanumeric hand gestures in real time.

## Installions of various software platforms and packages

I worked on Jupyter Notebook

> #### the various software packages required-->
> - numpy
> - openCV
> - matplotlib
> - PIL
> - os
> - random
> - scikitlearn
> - tensorflow
> - keras
> - freenect

**__You must install the above packages and the software platform to proceed__**


## Training our neural network 

> - open rgb_train_aug.ipynb file to proceed

> - run each cell one after the other **in order**

> - Finally *save the weights and model architecture.* __This file will be summoned during testing.__


## REAL TIME TESTING OF OUR MODEL
> - open REAL_TIME_PREDICTION.ipynb file to proceed
> - run each cell one after the other **in order**
